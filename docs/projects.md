# Projects

When you connect to planetsmasher, you'll initially be located in your `$HOME`
directory, which is `/home/your_username`

Space in the `/home/` directory is limited, so we kindly ask you not to store
large amount of data or files in your home directory. Moreover, the `/home`
directories will not be subject to backups!

## The /proj directory

The proj directory hosts projects. Each project is a directory that ideally
contains data, scripts and results for one scientific project.

Users can be members of up to 15 projects and projects can host many members

The proj directory will be subject to backups.

## What's my home for then?

Your home should be for small tests and hosting custom software or scripts you
may be using. It can also host user libraries (i.e. R packages)

## Asking for a project

For registering a new project, please email hadrien.gourle  (at) slu.se with
the following information:

* name of the project (no spaces, all lowercase)
* brief description of the project (one sentence)
* members of the project

Once created, your project will be located in `/proj/name_of_project`
